# PCAP

This is the code from the course [Python Essentials 2](https://edube.org/study/pe2). 

In the initial modules and labs I just included the code. Some of it is mine and some of it is starting or example code from the lectures.

In later modules I've also included the instructions and committed the base code as a starting point, so that my solution can be compared with what I was given to start with.

As with the [PCEP repository](https://github.com/ChariseWalraven/pcep-labs-projects) containing the labs and projects from the Python Essentials 1 course, my goal with these labs was to solve the problem with just the tools and topics covered in the lecutures of the course, to best understand the content and later pass the PCAP exam.

Please keep that in mind when you inspect the code. There are far more sophisticated solutions, but that was not my goal in my case.
